# WebDev St Paul Crime SPA

**St. Paul Crime Map** is an interactive, responsive single-page web application built with Vue.js that allows users to explore and investigate crime data across St. Paul neighborhoods. The app integrates multiple APIs, including Leaflet for mapping, Nominatim for location search, and a custom crime data API, enabling users to view, filter, and analyze crime information on an interactive map. A companion **About the Project** page documents the team, development process, and highlights key findings from the data.
